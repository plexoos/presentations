<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Introduction</h1>

- An Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) Software Meeting on Detector and Physics
  Simulations was held on July 10, 2019<br>
  See agenda at https://indico.bnl.gov/event/6336/

  - Organized by the EIC User Group

  - Focus on current and near term simulation needs in support of users doing
  physics performance and detector design studies

  - Progress reports on current full and fast simulation software efforts

  - Discussion on how to improve commonality and to allow users to work with
  multiple detector concepts easily without learning different systems

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Historic Background</h1>

<div style="font-size: smaller">

- Three years ago (June 2016) a **"computing" proposal was submitted** for

  "Developing Analysis Tools and Techniques for the EIC"

- Committee report in June 2016

  "[...] The consortium also proposes to work towards a common geometry and
   detector interface and a unified track reconstruction. [...] All tools would be
   organized within a software repositories dedicated to the EIC that would be
   embedded in an EIC-wide community website."

   - **The proposal was funded**
   &ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>

- Committee report in January 2019

  "The feedback from the user community indicates that **there is a keen desire to
  have access to reliable and easy simulation and reconstruction frameworks**. It
  seems that there remains a threshold for users to quickly engage in Monte Carlo
  simulations to carry out an end-to-end evaluation of various detector designs
  and study the EIC physics performance for different detector
  configurations. [...] The effort on providing common interfaces is strongly
  supported"

  - **It is clear that we are not there yet**

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Goals and Expected Features</h1>

- Detector R&D groups working on certain sub-detectors would like to see how
their systems fit and perform in the common setup

- **If the EIC User Group finds a workable solution now, chances are high that it
will be picked up by the actual collaboration later**

- Practical requirements on what a fresh EIC user would like to have:

  - Start with an existing EIC detector geometry proposal
    - Or bring his/her own detector in TGeo, xml, or Geant4 formats

  - Have an ability to (easily) add/remove/modify subdetectors and/or their
  parameters

  - With a given detector geometry run a simulation for events generated with
  one of the popular generators
  
  - The output should contain digitized hits with reconstructed tracks

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>What's Available</h1>

- EIC detector proposals
  - BeAST (BNL), ePhenix (BNL), JLEIC (JLAB), TOPSiDE (ANL)

- Frameworks
  - EicROOT, Fun4All, eJANA, (ANL?)

- Geometry description
  - TGeo, Geant4, xml, DD4hep

- Simulation
  - Geant4, eic-smear

- Reconstruction
  - GenFit, ...


</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>EicRoot</h1>

- Public repository
&ensp; <span id="questionmark-inline">?</span>

- Requires detector geometry in TGeo format

- Support full and fast simulation with Geant4 (Geant3 via VMC) and eic-smear respectively

- Supports digitization of simulated hits

- Track reconstruction is based on a known hit-to-track association followed by
a Kalman filter fit via GenFit
  - Acceptable for resolution studies, not for efficiency studies

</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>eic-smear</h1>


- Public repository
&ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>
  - https://gitlab.com/eic/eic-smear

- Documentation needs more work, already challenged by users

- Does not require any geometry

- Optional dependency on various generator

- Can be used for quick efficiency studies

- Delphes was not mentioned as an alternative to eic-smear
  - A framework for fast simulation of a generic collider experiment. Examples
  for CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, ...
  - Similar features
  - Active public repository with multiple forks, LICENSE, documentation
  &ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Fun4all</h1>

- Public repository
&ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>

- CI
&ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>

- The code is validated with real data. Trivially adopted for ePhenix

- The package organization and the code is too sPhenix oriented
&ensp; <span id="crossmark-inline">&#10007;</span>
  - Naming convention will be hardly welcomed by EIC users...
  - It is questionable if making the framework standalone will be supported by
  the authors

- No clear simple way for a new user to start using the framework
  - Links point to protected wiki pages

</textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>eJANA, g4e</h1>

- Based on JANA framework used for existing JLab experiments

- Not clear if source code for JANA is available
&ensp; <span id="questionmark-inline">?</span>

- Jupyter lab/notebook based front-end
&ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>

- Claimed to be compatible with eic-smear (to be verified...) and Geant4

- g4e: JLab EIC detector concept is implemented in Geant4

  - Many parameters hard coded but an effort is ongoing to disentangle
  configuration with a DB in mind

<!--
- So far, could not identify a new user to start using the 
-->

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>ANL EIC Software Initiative</h1>

- Was not covered extensively in the meeting...

</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>DD4hep</h1>

A software framework for providing a complete solution for full detector
description (geometry, materials, visualization, readout, alignment,
calibration, etc.)

- Public repository, LICENSE, documentation
&ensp; <span id="checkmark-inline">&#10003;</span>
  - https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep

- Surprisingly, hard to find a single entry point for a new user to start building a detector and run simulation
&ensp; <span id="crossmark-inline">&#10007;</span>
  - Massive manuals start with explanation of the architecture instead of a simplest example that just works

</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Summary</h1>

- Convergence to a common software stack has not happened after three years

- The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here>NIH</a> syndrome is hard to overcome

- Packaging all existing software into Docker containers considered as a near term path forward

  - The real reason for this choice is not clear...

  - Containers are appropriate for running. It is hard to develop within a container

  - Should not be a replacement for a standalone development
 
- For now agree on Geant4 C++ as the basis of detector description

  - 3 of the 4 approaches (excluding EicRoot) can work with C++ Geant4 detector descriptions

</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>General Recommendations</h1>

- README documentation close to the code

  - Clear installation instructions listing all external dependencies

  - A quick start documentation with half a dozen commands to copy and paste in
  the terminal command line

  - Should just work and produce an expected result

  - Each unexpected behavior will significantly demotivate the average user

  - At this stage an up-to-date README is more important then a separate website
  with the architectural design

</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>General Recommendations</h1>

- The source code should be in a public repository (github, gitlab)
  - A straightforward interface for issues, code browsing, static web hosting,
  ...
  - Automated builds and tests for continuous integration

- LICENSE
  - An open source license is an invitation for others to contribute
  - Without a license not clear if the authors want to share the source
  - Savvy developers won't contribute to a project without it
