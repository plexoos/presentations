<!--
Essentially two major tasks can be designated in the offline software corner
-->

- **Tracking.** Integration and comparison of two new tracking algorithms in the
forward region where `Sti` cannot perform **(Victor, Dmitri)**

  - `Stv` works with TGeo and non-uniform magnetic field

  - `Stg` is based on a combination of
  [KiTrack](https://github.com/iLCSoft/KiTrack) (a CA finder by iLC)
  + [GenFit](https://github.com/GenFit/GenFit).  The choice is dictated by the
  forward upgrade group and available manpower

  - No fundamental problems with moving forward with the integration identified
  at this time but people involved balance time between this and other work. (We
  are collaborating in [star-sw](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw) and using
  containers featured previously for testing. A big thank you to Daniel
  Brandenburg for valuable feedback!)

  - **The plan** is to save `Stg`'s tracks into the STAR microDST format (ROOT
  trees) and produce comparison plots based on existing STAR QA, i.e.
  reconstruction efficiency, statistical difference between simulated and
  reco'ed tracks

  - **The plan** is to make sure we do an apple-to-apple comparison by utilizing
  containers. This may require us to learn/use singularity to run on RACF

  - Currently there seems to be little connection to the next task...

- **Performance and regression tests** of STAR software builds (in general)
  **(Amol, Dmitri)**

  - [BirdView](https://birdview.sdcc.bnl.gov/) is a tool to monitor changes in
  basic test jobs parameters (e.g.  memory usage, CPU time, some per event
  quantities such as the average number of tracks). Currently works by parsing
  jobs log files. Now available on github: https://github.com/BNLNPPS/BirdView

  - The saga with the switch to 64-bit releases is ongoing

    - As reported last time there appears to be no fundamental problem with
    64-bit builds when tested in a CentOS7/SL7 container. Jobs timing is as
    expected, no difference between the CMake and cons builds

    - This is not the case when running in the centralized setup directly on
    RACF

  - **The plan** is to confirm the above on a larger scale by running all of the
  existing tests and display the results in BirdView

    - Option 1 (easier). Someone with access to the central account builds STAR
    soft by following the container recipe and runs test jobs

    - Option 2 (slower). Dmitri provides log files by running the test jobs but
    the procedure needs to be adopted for a regular user
