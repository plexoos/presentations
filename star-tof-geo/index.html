<section> <h1>Constructing BTOF Geometry from ROOT's TGeo<br><span style="font-size: 0.5em;">Dmitri Smirnov, S&C<br>February 28, 2018</span></h1>

<ul style="margin-top: 2em;">

   <li> Position of BTOF modules is used in official <c>StBTofMatchMaker</c> to
   match tracks to BTOF cells

   <li> BTOF library creates an internal set of volumes based on ROOT's
   <c>TVolume</c> using full <c>Geant3</c> geometry as input

   <li> This makes real data reconstruction jobs depend on <c>Geant3</c> <strong>simulation</strong> library

   <ul>
      <li> There is no other need for <c>Geant3</c> in reco jobs. Therefore, it is desirable to remove such dependency
   </ul>

   <li> Changes to BTOF geometry in <c>StBTofUtil</c> have been proposed by
   S&amp;C and reviewed by Frank (TOF expert)

</ul>

</section>



<section> <h1>Tests for new BTOF Geometry</h1>

<ul>

   <li> Verified the BTOF volume positions and dimensions before and after switching to <c>TGeo</c>

   <ul>
      <li> Observed small difference in the 4-5th decimal digits. This converts
      to ~10 micron variations, negligible for vast majority of physics analyses

      <li> Numerical differences also expected as <c>Geant3</c> uses single
      precision for volume position whereas <c>TGeo</c> uses double.
      Spacial transformations are also different

   </ul>

   <li> With high level tests verified the number of BTOF matched tracks

   <ul>

      <li> Reconstructed 100 events from Runs 15, 16, and 17

      <li> Small difference in the number of total matches. In Run 16, 3 out
      of 100 events had 1 mismatch in ~1000 tracks per event

      <li> For this statistics no difference found in number of "good" track matches

   </ul>

   <li> After integration the nightly tests did not report any issues

   <li> More precise tests are left to the BTOF users and experts...

</ul>

</section>



<section> <h1>Summary</h1>

<ul style="margin-top: 3em;">

   <li> BTOF geometry in <c>StBTofUtil</c> has been refactored to use
   <c>TGeo</c>. Deployed on Feb 26, 2018

   <li> Removal of <c>Geant3</c> from reconstruction jobs has a positive impact

   <ul>

      <li> Opens path to 64-bit builds of STAR libraries. From this alone we
      already expect speed up of reco jobs by ~15% 

      <li> Possible switch to vanilla <c>root</c> in place of <c>root4star</c>
      for jobs where interface to Fortran <c>Geant3</c> libraries and dependency
      on <c>cernlib</c> libraries are not required

      <li> Allowed to avoid problems with optimized fortran code (See Gene's
      report on missing half of BTOF detector)

   </ul>

   <li> There is an ongoing work on ETOF software (Daniel B., Florian S.) for
   which a similar approach to geometry construction should be taken

</ul>
