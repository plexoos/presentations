<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Motivation</h1>

- For over 20 years STAR relied on **`CVS`**, a centralized version control
  system, for storing code, external packages, and even calibration data and
  analyses notes

- **`Git`** is a distributed version control systems. The principal difference
  between **`CVS`** and **`Git`** is usually regarded as the ability for each
  developer to have the full control over a local copy of the entire code
  revision history

- <img style="float: right; width: 40%; border: 0;" src="graphics/commit_history.png" />

  **`Git`** has powerful branching
  capabilities. Developing new features on a new branch ensures that the main
  branch is not affected

- Creating and merging branches in **`Git`** is admittedly easier than in
  **`CVS`**

- **`Git`** is widely accepted by software developers owing to its usability and
  performance

  - Many nuclear and particle physics experiments have switched to **`Git`**
    long time ago. See public repositories of [ALICE](https://github.com/alisw),
    [ATLAS](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas), [CMS](https://github.com/cms-sw/),
    DUNE, [EIC](https://github.com/eic/), sPHENIX

  - STAR is probably the only active NPP experiment that does not use **`Git`**

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Working with CVS</h1>

<div style="display: flex; margin-left: 0em;">
<div style="width: 24%;">

<img style="border: 0;" src="graphics/cvs_screenshot.png" />

</div>
<div style="width: 76%; font-size: 100%;">

- STAR code is distributed via AFS and requires additional security measures
  even for read-only access

  <pre class="code"><code data-trim class="shell">
  /afs/rhic.bnl.gov/star/packages/repository
  </code></pre>

- In general, working with STAR code on a machine outside of RACF facilities
  requires a non-trivial setup 

  - Running full simulation or a reconstruction job on a user desktop/laptop is
    not a straight forward task


<hr width=50%>


- <div style="float: right; font-size:80%;">
  <pre><code data-trim class="shell">
  ...
  53M     ./asps
  67M     ./HISTORY

  </code></pre>
  </div>
  The large repo size built up over the years may not look attractive to new
  contributors. One needs to know exactly what to checkout

- Peer reviews are done only for completely new code. Little chance to review or
  comment on follow-up changes

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Migrating STAR Code to Git</h1>

<div style="font-size: 100%;">

- Switching to Git can be seen as an opportunity to reduce the size of the
  codebase without affecting the primary objectives&mdash;event simulation and
  reconstruction

- The focus of this migration is on the "offline" code responsible for event
  reconstruction, geometry, simulation, calibration, and database interaction

- A significant fraction of the "offline" code consists of external MC
  generators (Pythia, HIJING, UrQMD, ...). Since these are rarely touched it was
  decided to extract these codes in a separate repository

  <img style="float: right; width: 40%; border: 0;" src="graphics/cvs2git.png" />
- After considering several skimming scenarios the one producing main repo with
  a bare size of abot 180MB was selected. For details see [Backup Slides](#/excluded)

- All tools and scripts necessary to perform the migration are available from
  a separate repository hosted on **GitHub**<br>
  https://github.com/star-bnl/star-git-tools

  - <span style="font-size: 80%;">With little effort the scripts can be reused
    to extract the rest of the code from CVS, e.g. the "online" code</span>

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Hosting Git Repositories</h1>

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

- Following the practice established by other experiments and the BNL NPPS
  group, **GitHub** is chosen to host the STAR's Git repository
  <img style="float: right; width: 40%; border: 0;" src="graphics/github_star-sw.png" />

- **Github** services offer easy auditing of branches and code merges

  - Convenient interfaces for new code integration, peer reviews, and issue
    follow-ups

  - For students additional exposure to popular software development tools and
    services

- The two primary repositories are available on **GitHub** and synced with CVS
  on a daily basis

  - https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw  &mdash; Contains most of the migrated
    code except MC generators

  - https://github.com/star-bnl/star-mcgen &mdash; Contains MC generators and
    the respective interfaces to `starsim`

- Since the above repositories currently operate in read only mode another
  repository was created for testing purposes. It can be used to test
  **GitHub**'s interface, e.g. create issues, pull requests, etc.

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Typical Workflow with Git Repositories</h1>

<div style="font-size: 95%;">

- **Note**: A GitHub account is required for work with the new Git
  repositories

  - Various notifications may be sent to your email as essential part of the
    work. They are highly customizable via your account settings

- The expected workflow with a central repository is very typical and common for
  many projects hosted on GitHub:

  - **Fork the repo.** Create a "copy" of the central repository under your
    account

  - **Clone your fork.** Create a local "copy" of the repository on your machine

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:<account>/star-sw.git
    ```

  - **Make changes locally.** Create clean commits with informative log messages
    by using the full power of Git tools &#128512;

  - **Push to your fork.** Send the changes to your fork hosted on GitHub

    ```shell
    $ git push 
    ```

  - **Create a pull request.** Let others know that you want to merge your
    changes into the central repository

- Documentation and tutorials on both Git and GitHub available online. See [Backup Slides](#/documentation)

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Notes on Policies</h1>

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

- GitHub allows to configure and enforce certain workflows for collaborative
  development. We suggest to start with rules consistent with historical
  development in CVS

- **Protect all branches:** Disable force pushes and prevent branches from being deleted

- **Maintain linear history:** Prevent merge commits from being pushed to branches

  - Linear history is usually easier for humans to understand and debug

- **Require pull requests on GitHub** as the only way to merge commits onto
remote branch

  - Direct pushes to remote branches are disabled for all collaborators

  - PRs encourage better documentation of proposed changes (via GitHub interface)

- **Require pull request reviews before merging**

  - GitHub can suggest reviewers based on historical code changes

  - We suggest two required approving reviews from code owners/maintainers
    before a pull request can be merged
  
    - Similar to `CVSROOT/avail` we create a `CODEOWNERS` file in our repository
      mapping subdirectories to specific people whose approval is required. For
      example, see
      https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw-test/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS
  
  - In cases when reviewers cannot be easily identified the Infrastructure Team
  will step in

<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Sparse Checkout and Partial Clone Features</h1>

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

<span style="font-size: 80%;">**Note**: The size of `star-sw` bare and checked
    out `HEAD` is 180MB and 470MB. The quota for STAR users on RACF is
    25GB</span>

- **Sparse checkout** is a checkout of a pre-selected subset of subdirectories
  specified by the user. The complete history is still available locally in
  local `.git` directory

<!--
Can be converted to a full checkout any time
It is available since early versions of Git and works reliably. UI improved in
recent versions
-->

- **Partial clone** allows to limit the number of past file revisions
  immediately available for offline work. The initially missing information is
  downloaded later if needed transparently to the user. Works well in
  conjunction with sparse checkouts.

<!--
It is a relatively new feature (documented in recent versions). UI does not
appear very stable
-->

- Custom Git commands for STAR users can be installed from
  https://github.com/star-bnl/star-git-tools

</textarea>
</section>



<section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> <h1>Additional Notes</h1>

- The centralized nature of **`CVS`** requires a stricter and more rigorous
  control over developers allowed to make changes to the public repository

  - There is a big gap between users with write access and everyone else

- There is an opinion that in software development it is better to rely on
  social restrictions (such as code reviews) than on technical restrictions

- Require status checks to pass before merging. Currently, there are no
  automatic status checks

  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
